## By Future Interns  

# 🚨 Churn Prediction System

## 🔍 About the Task
In this hands-on internship project, you’ll develop a **Churn Prediction System** that identifies which customers are likely to stop using a service. This kind of model is crucial in industries.

## ✅ What You’ll Do
- Explore and clean a customer dataset (telecom, banking, or subscription data).  
- Engineer relevant features like contract type, payment method, or service usage.  
- Train and test classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).  
- Evaluate model **accuracy, precision, recall**, and churn probabilities.  
- Visualize key churn drivers and insights using **Power BI** or **Matplotlib**.   

## 🎯 Skills You’ll Gain
- 🧠 **Classification & predictive modeling**  
- 🧹 **Data wrangling and feature engineering**  


## 🛠️ Tools You’ll Use
- **Python** – Primary language for data analysis and modeling  
- **Pandas & Scikit-learn** – For data preparation and ML
